## Native apps
      A native application is a software program that is developed for use on a particular platform or device.Because a native app is built for use on a particular device
 and its OS, it has the ability to use device-specific hardware and software. Native apps can provide optimized performance and take advantage of the latest technology,
 such as a GPS, compared to web apps or mobile cloud apps developed to be generic across multiple systems.
 
 ## Operating Systems
           An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.An
  operatingsystem (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.For hardware
  functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, although the
  application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are
  found on many devices that contain a computer â€“ from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.
   
## What is Virtualization?
         Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted from the actual hardware. Most commonly, it refers to
  running multiple operating systems on a computer system simultaneously. To the applications running on top of the virtualized machine, it can appear as if they are
  on their own dedicated machine, where the operating system, libraries, and other programs are unique to the guest virtualized system and unconnected to the host
  operating system which sits below it.
        There are many reasons why people utilize virtualization in computing. To desktop users, the most common use is to be able to run applications meant for a
  different operating system without having to switch computers or reboot into a different system. For administrators of servers, virtualization also offers the
  ability to run different operating systems, but perhaps, more importantly, it offers a way to segment a large system into many smaller parts, allowing the server
  to be used more efficiently by a number of different users or applications with different needs. It also allows for isolation, keeping programs running inside of
  a virtual machine safe from the processes taking place in another virtual machine on the same host.
