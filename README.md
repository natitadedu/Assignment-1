## What are Transistors?
     A transistor is built from a semiconductor element which is silicon and used to amplify or switch electrical signals and power.
-It is one of the basic building blocks of every electronic device. Every microchip contains a transistor.
-It works by regulating or controlling current or voltage flow in addition to amplifying and generating these electrical signals and acting as a switch or gate for them.
-Transistors are important because it has only one circuit element. In small quantities, and they are the basic elements in integrated circuits.
Typically, transistors consist of three layers, or terminals, of a semiconductor material, each of which can carry a current.When working as an amplifier, a transistor transforms a small input current into a bigger output current. As a switch, it can be in one of two distinct states -- on or off -- to control the flow of electronic signals through an electrical circuit or electronic device.
### Why transistors are improtant.
    On its own, a transistor has only one circuit element. In small quantities, transistors are used to create simple electronic switches. They are the basic elements in integrated circuits (ICs), which consist of a large number of transistors interconnected with circuitry and baked into a single silicon microchip.
    In large numbers, transistors are used to create microprocessors where millions of transistors are embedded into a single IC. They also drive computer memory chips and memory storage devices for MP3 players, smartphones, cameras and electronic games. Transistors are deeply embedded in nearly all ICs, which are part of every electronic device.
    Transistors are also used for low-frequency, high-power applications, such as power-supply inverters that convert alternating current into direct current. Additionally, transistors are used in high-frequency applications, such as the oscillator circuits used to generate radio signals.


## Moores law?
    Mores law is stated by Gorden moore law the law is named after him. He is the founder and former CEO of intel. he stated that "The number of transistors on a microchip will double every two years, while the price of the device will be cut in half". That means computers will get smaller, faster and even more cheaper.
    The law claims that we can expect the speed and capability of our computers to increase every two years because of this, yet we will pay less for them. Another tenet of Moore's Law asserts that this growth is exponential.
    Gordon Moore did not call his observation "Moore's Law," nor did he set out to create a "law." Moore made that statement based on noticing emerging trends in chip manufacturing at Fairchild Semiconductor. Eventually, Moore's insight became a prediction, which in turn became the golden rule known as Moore's Law.
    In the decades that followed Gordon Moore's original observation, Moore's Law guided the semiconductor industry in long-term planning and setting targets for research and development (R&D). Moore's Law has been a driving force of technological and social change, productivity, and economic growth that are hallmarks of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.
    
## Lambda Calculus?
   Lambda Calculus is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. It is a universal model of computation that can be used to simulate any Turing machine. It was introduced by the mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of his research into the foundations of mathematics.
   Lambda calculus may be untyped or typed. In typed lambda calculus, functions can be applied only if they are capable of accepting the given input's "type" of data. Typed lambda calculi are weaker than the untyped lambda calculus, which is the primary subject of this article, in the sense that typed lambda calculi can express less than the untyped calculus can, but on the other hand typed lambda calculi allow more things to be proven; in the simply typed lambda calculus it is, for example, a theorem that every evaluation strategy terminates for every simply typed lambda-term, whereas evaluation of untyped lambda-terms need not terminate. One reason there are many different typed lambda calculi has been the desire to do more (of what the untyped calculus can do) without giving up on being able to prove strong theorems about the calculus.
   Lambda calculus has applications in many different areas in mathematics, philosophy,linguistics,and computer science.Lambda calculus has played an important role in the development of the theory of programming languages. Functional programming languages implement lambda calculus.Lambda calculus is also a current research topic in category theory.

## How computer works?
   A computer, a digital information-processing machine, works by changing information into binary numbers (ones and zeros) and then using simple mathematics to make decisions about how to rearrange those numbers into words or actions. A digital system stores and operates  on information in a very specific way by storing information in a bit (or multiple collections of bits). A bit is a variable that can have only one of two values: it can either be a 1, or be a 0.
   There are two main things to understanding the basics of how a computer works: 
• A computer treats any type of information (not only numbers but also letters, words, dates) as if it consisted simply of binary ones and zeros. For example, a computer can translate the letter “A” typed into its keyboard into a string of ones and zeros, such as 1000001. One reason for this is that once it is in a binary form, the information can be stored and moved about more easily. On a hard disc, the “ones” could be stored as magnetized spots on the disc, while the zeroes can be stored as un-magnetized spots. Once information has been converted to ones and zeros, the computer can get to work. 
• The second point to consider is that the computer’s functions are based on the movement and transformation of electrical pulses (representing ones and zeroes) in electrical circuits. Inside the computer are electrical circuits that decode the zeros and ones, by 
adding and subtracting them. These circuits are called the logic of the computer, because the calculations they make are similar to simple logic decisions. For example, if you press the A key on the computer keyboard, circuits inside the computer receive pulses of electricity representing the A in binary form - 1000001. Those pulses are sent to logic circuits that make yes or no decisions based on the input they receive. A very simple example would be a circuit that determines whether the input send to it is a one or a zero. The output of the circuit is a new piece of information - a binary one or zero that is the result of the simple yes or no decision
