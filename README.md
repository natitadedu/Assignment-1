## What are Transistors
     A transistor is built from a semiconductor element which is silicon and used to amplify or switch electrical signals and power.
-It is one of the basic building blocks of every electronic device. Every microchip contains a transistor.
-It works by regulating or controlling current or voltage flow in addition to amplifying and generating these electrical signals and acting as a switch or gate for them.
Transistors are important because it has only one circuit element. In small quantities, and they are the basic elements in integrated circuits.
